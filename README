Zombi is a survival horror game which takes place in a mansion.  The goal is to
survive until help arrives.  Players have a limited amount of healing items and
weapons at their disposal.  An introduction to how the player gets in the
predicament they're in may make it into the game, for now the effort is
concentrated on getting the player playing.

Currently, the game is planned for Linux and Windows platforms, with Linux
being the lead platform.  An OpenGL 3.3 or better graphics card is required.
